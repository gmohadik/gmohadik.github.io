        "friend", or, with a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join
        common-interest groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their
        Facebook friends' activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook claimed that it had more
